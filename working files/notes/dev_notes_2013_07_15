gave root user a p/w

put f-test.local in the config file as the agentsmight machine
fab pre_install --hosts=f-test.local -u root

set aside a template after the pre-install script,

done for the day, need to figure out repo updates and major versions of stuff

I was trying to install el6 stuff on my 7.1 machine.

Also, not 100% sure I am 64 bit...

Used oVirt web interface 
  force remove Default DataCenter

sudo yum update foreman* ruby*
(won't have to do this with a new install)

deleted compute resource, got query error looking for datacenter

renamed local_cluster to localcluster
can't rename data center
make a new one

making a home/ovirt folder for local storage

in the oVirt install, rename data center something without an underscore

upgrading oVirt

# to make a VM

New VM
Step through Advanced options
Do NOT select a CD image here
Add storage
Go to list, select VM and choose Run Once
Attach an ISO as CD drive with whatever you want to install
After a delay, indicator will turn green
Right click and choose Console
If you have your browser set to open .vv files with some kind of VNC viewer, you should be connected
If (like me) you are on a Mac and don't have a VNC client installed, open the .vv file in a text editor
Download Chicken of the VNC
Make a new connection in Chicken, no need to save anything
Get the port and password from that .vv file (apparently port in the file is)

# current commands

New plan, 2 hardware machines, agentsmith for The Foreman, DNS and DHCP and second, zion for oVirt host and management app.

Need to do agentsmith first, since he will have DNS entries for zion.

for agentsmith (The Foreman and Puppet):

need host file on workstation to start

fab pre_install --hosts=agentsmith.tinisi.local -u root
fab install_foreman --hosts=agentsmith.tinisi.local -u tinisi
fab restart_foreman_services --hosts=agentsmith.tinisi.local -u tinisi

for zion (oVirt host and management all in one):

fab pre_install --hosts=zion.tinisi.local -u root
fab install_ovirt --hosts=zion.tinisi.local -u tinisi

fab bind.configure_hosts --hosts=agentsmith.tinisi.local -u tinisi

# TODO

[ ] get a better handle on which services start when, at the end of everything they should all be started
[ ] these services might need chkconfig commands to make them stay up:
  libvirtd
  messagebus <== I think this is the only one I need to use chkconfig with, not sure I still need it now that using oVirt
  foreman-proxy
  foreman (I think Passenger takes care of this)
[ ] get ntp working because when clock is wrong, DNS with keys doesn't workaround
  * as a workaround for now add a step to manual config to set clock correctly at BIOS
[ ] fully remove the libvirt config and installs no longer needed now that we are using ovirt
  * the method configure_libvirt() will need to be refactored, other actions can just be removed, search the TODOs
[ ] normalize permissions on moved files and templates, tinisi owns some stuff he shouldn't
[ ] add step at the end to change to sudo with password
[ ] add step at the end to put debug level back down from debug
[X] generalize adding one to n DNS records, need to set up record for zion
  * refactor all the bind config stuff
  * make separate method for configuring bind (all the key stuff is there)
  * and another method that can be run any time that adds one to n host and reverse entries
[X] manually add DNS entry for zion, change zion to use agentsmith in resolv.conf
[X] make a generalized way to disallow remote root log in or not
[LATER] make a step to create hosts file with an arbitrary number of host/ip combos
  * this could be in a generalized LINUX install script
[LATER] generalize the initial creation of "static" DNS entries so I can create 1 to n entries based on the host file config
  * for now "hard coding" the entries for 2 records, this could be in a generalized LINUX install script later
[X] set up sudo with no password for wheel initially
[X] add a method at the end to spit out the installed packages for logging
[X] changing sudoers file in a few other places, and not doing the check using visudo
[NOPE] thinking each package should have a "run_all()" method or something like that which is default
  * changing my mind about this, it is so convenient to mix and match methods in the top level package
[NOPE] implement roles and switch to useing execute()
  * roles don't work quite like I thought...putting this off and keeping different methods for oVirt machine and Foreman
[NOPE] need to rebuild zion one more time and figure out how to build answer file
  * current;y answer file is incomplete, leaving it interactive

sudo yum --assumeyes install foreman-ovirt
sudo service foreman restart

engine-iso-uploader upload -i ISO_DOMAIN 

10/13/2013

192.168.0.10    agentsmith.tinisi.local
192.168.0.11    zion.tinisi.local

New instructions will be for 2 actual machines. One bare metal install for DNS, DHCP and The Foreman (agentsmith), second for oVirt all in one and management interface.

If instructions are to build agentsmith first, he will have DNS entry for zion.

10/12/2013

Yeah buddy! Got a VM created in oVirt tonight.

I have to hack my way into a VNC connection, but otherwise looks like I am good.

10/11/2013

sudo yum install --assumeyes ovirt-engine-websocket-proxy

can't figure out how to start it...

10/10/2013

w00T!
I think the install worked
storage domain connected and host apparently working
uploading iso of netboot for CentOS6.4 (total guess)

sudo engine-iso-uploader upload -i ISO_DOMAIN CentOS-6.4-x86_64-netinstall.iso
sudo engine-iso-uploader upload -i ISO_DOMAIN CentOS-6.4-x86_64-minimal.iso

10/9/2013

new hosts file:
192.168.0.10    rancho.tinisi.local
192.168.0.11    zion.tinisi.local
192.168.0.12    host.tinisi.local
192.168.0.13    storage.tinisi.local
192.168.0.14    matrix.tinisi.local

10/6/2013

Made separate methods so I can install just oVirt, and then hopefully install Foreman etc on a VM.

command line tool
http://www.ovirt.org/CLI

sudo engine-setup --generate-answer=ovirt_answers.conf

to complete install, oVirt engine needs to be able to ssh to localhost as root, so changed /etc/sshd_config to allow

10/1/2013

had the issue again with date being off
set the date, and restarted named
date -s "Tue Oct 1 21:14:00 CDT 2013"

still no name resolution with my server, getting broken trust chain errors
changed dnssec-validation no; (was yes)

continued with installer

Welcome to oVirt Engine setup utility

In order to proceed the installer must stop the ovirt-engine service
Would you like to stop the ovirt-engine service? (yes|no): yes
 oVirt Engine uses httpd to proxy requests to the application server.
It looks like the httpd installed locally is being actively used.
The installer can override current configuration .
Alternatively you can use JBoss directly (on ports higher than 1024)
Do you wish to override current httpd configuration and restart the service? ['yes'| 'no']  [yes] : no
HTTP Port  [8700] : 
HTTPS Port  [8701] : 
Host fully qualified domain name. Note: this name should be fully resolvable  [zion.tinisi.local] : 
zion.tinisi.local did not resolve into an IP address
User input failed validation, do you still wish to use it? (yes|no): no
Host fully qualified domain name. Note: this name should be fully resolvable  [zion.tinisi.local] : 
The IP 192.168.0.11 does not hold a PTR record for the FQDN: zion.tinisi.local
User input failed validation, do you still wish to use it? (yes|no): yes
Enter a password for an internal oVirt Engine administrator user (admin@internal) :
Warning: Weak Password.
Confirm password :
Organization Name for the Certificate  [tinisi.local] : Tinisi
The default storage type you will be using  ['NFS'| 'FC'| 'ISCSI'| 'POSIXFS']  [NFS] : 
Enter DB type for installation ['remote'| 'local']  [local] : 
Enter a password for a local oVirt Engine DB admin user (engine) :
Warning: Weak Password.
Confirm password :
Configure NFS share on this server to be used as an ISO Domain? ['yes'| 'no']  [yes] : 
Local ISO domain path  [/var/lib/exports/iso] : 
Firewall ports need to be opened.
The installer can configure iptables automatically overriding the current configuration. The old configuration will be backed up.
Alternately you can configure the firewall later using an example iptables file found under /etc/ovirt-engine/iptables.example
Configure iptables ? ['yes'| 'no']: yes

oVirt Engine will be installed using the following configuration:

giving up for now, gonna wipe the machine and make sure the script works.

my ISP will be using ovirt instead of libvirt, and apparently I don't have enough RAM for ovirt.

need to pursue some hardware...fuck

[ ] This didn't make any difference
enabled tsl in qemu.conf

mkdir /etc/pki/libvirt-vnc

NOPE!

# following instructions to make ssh keys for foreman user

(decided this is a dead end, NOT adding it to the script)

as root:
mkdir /usr/share/foreman/.ssh
chown foreman .ssh
chmod g=,o= .ssh
chgrp foreman .ssh

make ssh folder for root
put foreman key in authoriazed_keys
had to re-anable remote root log on

using this for address:
qemu+ssh://root@192.168.0.11/system

per Darrel:
service dnsmasq stop
chkconfig dnsmasq off

http://emeraldreverie.org/blog/2012/10/26/creating-development-environment-with/

trying his edit to the network in virsh, adding bootp

also used settings page and set Token_duration to 60 min

looks like restarting mesagebus helped

service messagebus restart

in the Foreman admin web interface:
* gave admin user ALL roles
* changed token timeout setting to 60 min

# 9/4/2013

[X] added these to the libvirtd config

key_file = "/var/lib/puppet/ssl/private_keys/zion.tinisi.local.pem"
cert_file = "/var/lib/puppet/ssl/certs/zion.tinisi.local.pem"
ca_file = "/var/lib/puppet/ssl/certs/ca.pem"

changed path to dhcpd.conf in proxy config!

http://itscblog.tamu.edu/startup-guide-for-kvm-on-centos-6/
(might just be able to restart?)

dbus-uuidgen > /var/lib/dbus/machine-id
service messagebus restart

now I can test the connection to the hypervisor!

seems Foreman is talking to libvirt!!!!!
I can see drives being created in my storage pool and no errors when I save host
but DHCP auto suggest of addresses still not working
and after save of host, nothing is listed in host list and nothing built
could be at this point I just have wrong recipe of templates
time to rebuild from scratch and get a note off to db for instructions

all known steps done, troubleshooting

tried to run installer again

echo include foreman_installer | puppet apply --modulepath /usr/share/foreman-installer

got loads of errors related to fqdn

edited puppet.conf, added server to match rancho

manually re-ran commands to shutoff iptables and set permissive ESLinux

then, named would start

error in apache
/etc/httpd/conf.d/foreman.conf
ServerName takes one argument, The hostname and port of the server

configs were all f'ed up, probably from re-install attempt, if more of this, time to start over

# 8/23/2013

flailing to get named working
already added the selinux and iptables stuff to the os script

any of these things might have to be added
    # chown root named.conf
    # chmod o=r named.iscdlv.key
    # chown named:named named.conf
    # chown named:named /etc/rndc.key
    # chmod 644 /etc/rndc.key


get ntp working

	ntpdate ntp.pool.org
	hwclock --systohc

rm /var/named/dynamic/managed-keys.bind*
service named restart

just setting the clock to be closer to correct got DNS forwards working with keys
look at adding proper ntp set up to system

# 7/27/2013

to test the current code:

on each host make a folder for some test files in ~
mkdir ~/zion_test

put something like this in your .fabricrc
zion_config_file = /full/path/to/this/src/zion/config/prod.json

workon zion_v_1
	switch to zion_v_1 environment in virtualenv
fab install --hosts=localhost,rancho.tinisi.com
	run the current script in fabfile folder/package
	(this most simple example assumed you have a user with same name as local on all hosts)

on each host this should result in:

cd ~/zion_test
ls -1
bind.install
dhcp.install
foreman.install
install
os.setup
puppet.install
user.create
	
an empty file for each method/action in each package
and the file install should have something like this:

host ip: 192.168.0.12
debug: False
