# manual steps

[X] instructions for minimal install CD with defaults

[ ] TODO: look for check box to make network "automatic" (changes DHCP to ONBOOT-yes)

# pre_install
	centos.enable_sudo (as root)

[X] give wheel sudo
 	- copy sudo file to temp spot
	 - use fabric command to un-comment line in default file
	 - use visudo -q -c -s -f on new file to check it
	 - swap out the temp file

# pre_install
	centos.add_users

[X] made user for tinisi
[X] put tinisi in wheel

# install
	centos.ssh_lockdown

[X] change these from default in /etc/ssh/sshd_config
	Port 22 <= this is actually the default
	Protocol 2 <= this is actually the default
	PermitRootLogin no
	UseDNS no

# install
    centos.update

[X] sudo yum checkupdate
[X} sudo yum update
[X] yum list installed

# install
	centos.add_repos

[X] rpm -Uvh http://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/6/i386/epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm
	this adds the EPEL repo to yum:
	http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL/FAQ#How_can_I_install_the_packages_from_the_EPEL_software_repository.3F
[X] sudo rpm -ivh http://yum.puppetlabs.com/el/6/products/i386/puppetlabs-release-6-6.noarch.rpm
	this adds puppet labs to yum repos from here:
	http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/puppetlabs_package_repositories.html

# install
    bind.install

[X] sudo yum install bind-utils
[X] sudo yum install bind-libs
[X] sudo yum install bind
[X] sudo yum install bind-chroot
[X] followed instructions here to set up chrooted dns
	* per http://sysadminpy.com/sysadmin/2012/04/05/setting-up-foreman-on-centosrhel-57-part-2/#foreman_dependencies
	# cd /var/named/chroot/etc
	# dnssec-keygen -a HMAC-MD5 -b 128 -n HOST foreman

	# cat Kforeman.+157+51238.key
	foreman. IN KEY 512 3 157 [..key..]
	# cat Kforeman.+157+51238.private
	Private-key-format: v1.2
	Algorithm: 157 (HMAC_MD5)
	Key: [..key..]

	(use same as DHCP grep to pull out secret)

	config notes:

	build dns_admin_email from general admin_email replacing @ with .
	generate foreman_dns_key
	generate dns_hostname from full_domain_name (split on ., use first element)
	generate reverse_ip_sub (split ip on ., drop last segment and reverse order, ie 0.168.192)
	generate ip_sub (split ip on ., drop last segment, ie 192.168.0 )
	generate dns_domain_name from full_domain_name (split on ., use all but first elements)

# install
    dhcp.install

[X] sudo yum install dhcp
[X] used pretty much the exact dhcpd.conf file as here:
	http://sysadminpy.com/sysadmin/2012/04/05/setting-up-foreman-on-centosrhel-57-part-2
[X] set up dhcpd.conf per this web site:
	http://www.krizna.com/centos/install-configure-dhcp-server-centos-6/

[X]] generated DHCP key
sudo dnssec-keygen -r /dev/urandom -a HMAC-MD5 -b 512 -n HOST omapi_key
sudo cat Komapi_key.+*.private |grep ^Key|cut -d ' ' -f2-
[..key..]
[X] chkconfig --levels 235 dhcpd on

# install
    puppet.install

[X] sudo yum install ruby
	dependency for puppet
[X] sudo yum install puppet

# install
    foreman.install

[X] sudo yum install foreman-libvirt
	Darrell says I need this (installed ruby-libvirt instead per)
	NOTE: first run, I installed ruby-libvirt, did NOT uninstall it
	then I found the package foreman-libvirt
[X] sudo yum install libvirt
[X] sudo service libvirtd restart

[X] sudo yum -y install http://yum.theforeman.org/releases/1.1/el6/i386/foreman-release-1.1stable-3.el6.noarch.rpm
[X] sudo yum -y install foreman-installer
[X] sudo ruby /usr/share/foreman-installer/generate_answers.rb

this web site seems interesting:
[X] virsh iface-bridge eth0 br0
[X] vi 50-se.tmtowtdi-libvirt-local-access.pkla
vim /etc/polkit-1/localauthority/50-local.d/50-se.tmtowtdi-libvirt-local-access.pkla:
	[Allow foreman libvirt management permissions]
	Identity=unix-user:foreman
	Action=org.libvirt.unix.manage
	ResultAny=yes
	ResultInactive=yes
	ResultActive=yes

[X] added this to sudoer:
Defaults:foreman-proxy !requiretty
foreman-proxy ALL = NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/puppet
[X] created a storage pool
	root@rancho ~]# virsh pool-define pool.xml 
	Pool virtimages defined from pool.xml

	[root@rancho ~]# virsh pool-autostart virtimages
	Pool virtimages marked as autostarted

(foreman dhcp related tasks)
[X] added this to /etc/foreman-proxy/settings.yml
:dhcp_key_name: omapi_key
:dhcp_key_secret: [..key..]

:dns: false
:dns: true

:dns_key: /etc/rndc.key
:dns_key: /var/named/chroot/etc/Kforeman.+157+47825.private
	ls /var/named/chroot/etc/Kf*.key

#:dhcp_subnets: [192.168.205.0/255.255.255.128, 192.168.205.128/255.255.255.128]
:dhcp_subnets: [192.168.0.0/255.255.255.0]

#:log_level: DEBUG
:log_level: DEBUG

[X] now issue is proxy log says can't read dhcps conf or leases
[X] usermod -a -G dhcpd foreman-proxy
[X] made /etc/dhcp world readable and executable
chmod o=r dhcp
chmod o=rx ./dhcp

(foreman DNS relates tasks)
[X] added foreman-proxy to the named group:
usermod -a -G named foreman-proxy
so that this test will pass:

#
# remaining action log from rancho (steps to convert or delete)

[SKIPPABPE?] added this to /etc/host.conf

[ ] no love, from my laptop I get a null reply from port 80, and connection refused from port 443
[ ] from curl on rancho, I see a server error from port 443
[ ] logs show error:

[ ] now I can see the apache page with internal server error
[ ] but still no love, so running the installer again as root instead of through sudo
[ ] # ruby /usr/share/foreman-installer/generate_answers.rb
[SKIBBABLE] getting an error after upgrade (Could not find json-1.5.5 in any of the sources (Bundler::GemNotFound)
	did this per: http://projects.theforeman.org/projects/1/wiki/Troubleshooting
	rm ~foreman/Gemfile.lock
	cd ~foreman 
	bundle install --local
[SKIPPABLE?] man issue might be that the MAC field is hidden, using client side mojo to make it visible
[SKIPPABLE] new error, reverse DNS for matrix failing
[SKIPPABLE] added it to the hosts file
[SKIPPABLE] hacked my way through getting dns server working
[SKIPPABLE] removed the _mac.html.erb file I created
(not sure what this is)

This will configure Foreman, Foreman-Proxy, Puppet (including a puppetmaster),
several puppet environments, TFTP (for provisioning) and sudo (for puppet
certificate management)
